## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Wuqibor

- An ordinary high school test taker from small towm
- With dreams as vast as the sky
- It is a dance of joy for each keystroke and shoot
- Journey through the **Python**, **Golang**, **PHP**, and **JavaScript**
- Set my sights on **C#** now and learn desktop development
- Strive for a university degree through *the National College Entrance Examination*
- Dream of walking silently and peacefully with the one who graces my dreams, wishing to find their presence in every step I take
